This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we used various set of tools including AngryIPScanner,Global Network Inventory, NetScanTools Pro and Advanced Directory Explorer to perform enumeration on Windows to obtain OS information, Network resources, Usernames and user groups, Lists of shares on individual hosts on the network, Policies and passwords, Routing tables, Audit and service settings, SNMP and FQDN details. Although I think Linux was a tad bit easier since you donâ€™t have to go through all the tools. I believe if you get used to the commands for the Linux tool, it is much faster and easier to get information.
